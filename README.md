# CO₂ Emission Variations Among Nations | Clustering & PCA
# Project Overview
This project analyzes CO₂ emissions across different countries using Clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The goal is to identify patterns in emission levels, group similar nations based on emission characteristics, and reduce dimensionality for better visualization and insights.
# Data Source
The dataset contains CO₂ emissions and other related environmental indicators across multiple countries.
Data was collected from [mention source: e.g., World Bank, Kaggle, or any other dataset repository].
Features include total emissions, per capita emissions, energy consumption, and economic indicators.
# Key Techniques Used
✅ Data Preprocessing: Cleaning missing values, handling outliers, and standardizing numerical features.

✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing emissions distribution and correlations among factors.

✅ Clustering (K-Means / Hierarchical Clustering): Grouping countries based on emission patterns.

✅ Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Reducing dimensionality for better visualization and model performance.

✅ Heatmaps & Visualizations: To interpret the clustering results and compare nations.
# Results & Insights
Countries with high emissions tend to have strong industrial activities and higher GDP.

Low-emission clusters include smaller economies and island nations with lower industrialization.

PCA reduced dimensions from X to Y, helping visualize clusters more effectively
